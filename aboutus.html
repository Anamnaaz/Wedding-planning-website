                    <p>It was just an ordinary saturday afternoon when all of our classmates were
                         just chilling in  the classroom.
                        That's when our professor came and discussed on the group project.</p>

                    <h2>The Early Days</h2>
                    <p>In the early days, it wasn’t easy. We faced many challenges,
                         from setting up our website to building a brand and services that people would love. 
                         But every hurdle only made us stronger. We learned, we grew, and slowly but surely,
                          our dream started to take shape. Our mission was clear: to make your that'one moment memorable'.</p>
              <p>We learned a lot during this journey from effective teamwork and as we grew so our bonds did!!!,
                 from overcoming technical obstacles to understanding what our clients 
                 truly needed. These lessons shaped the foundation of everything we do today.</p>
